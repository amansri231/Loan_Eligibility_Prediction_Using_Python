# Loan_Eligibility_Prediction_Using_Python
This repository contains the loan eligibility prediction project created using Python.

A Brief Insight about the Project:
The Loan Eligibility Prediction model is a system that is developed using data science and machine learning algorithms that help to check whether a customer is eligible for
getting the loan based on the customer's application form while applying for the loan. This application form contains all the criteria for validating the eligibility of any applicant like Loan Amount, Loan Amount Term, Co-applicant income, Dependents, Applicant income, Gender, Credit history, Property area, and Marital Status.

Python libraries used in the Project:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit Learn

After successfully implementing the project, we can determine whether a customer should be given the loan by making the analysis using machine learning algorithms through Python.

Kindly go through the project and share your feedback and suggestions to improve it to the best level. Thank you all!
